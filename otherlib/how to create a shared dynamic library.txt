1. Create a folder called src. Write a program called 'divide.c' and expose a 'divide.h'
2. Create a makefile that has the following intruction

CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -g -Wall

all: libdivide.so

libdivide.so: divide.o
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) divide.o -shared -o libdivide.so
 
divide.o: divide.c divide.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -fPIC divide.c -o divide.o
    
3. This a creates a libdivide.so file
4. Copy this to the 'shared' folder
5. Copy the interface file called 'divide.h' and put it in the 'inc' folder.

6. Compile by mentioning this.
7. When calling the main program, set environmental variables to point to the shared library folder
